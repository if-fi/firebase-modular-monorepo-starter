/**
 * `api_booking` is a single callable gateway that hosts multiple internal endpoints.
 *
 * Routing is intentionally explicit and declarative:
 * - every exposed endpoint must be listed in `apiRoutes`
 * - we do NOT auto-route based on files/folders
 *
 * Risks of automatic routing:
 * - accidental exposure of internal/debug/admin modules as public endpoints
 * - auth/anonymous requirements applied inconsistently
 * - file renames/moves become behavior changes
 * - reviewers lose a single obvious allowlist to audit
